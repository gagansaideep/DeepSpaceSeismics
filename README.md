# DeepSpaceSeismics
This project uses deep learning techniques to detect seismic events from both lunar and Mars datasets. It processes raw seismic data, removes noise, trains models, and evaluates the performance on test data. The workflow is separated for lunar and Mars data, with each having its own preprocessing steps and model.
